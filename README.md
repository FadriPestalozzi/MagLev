Magnetic levitation is cool! 

Our goal is to create an intuitive magnetic levitation setup with off-the-shelf components

And it's an amazing playground for a hands-on learning experience with electronic components like: 
- Power Supply 
- Electromagnet
- IR-LED
- Phototransistor
- Op-Amp
- MOSFET
- Flyback Diode

# ToDos

- control current into electromagnet via Arduino
- read and display output of phototransistor with Arduino
- determine sensor range
